    title: "Introduction to the Fundamentals of Quantum Computing",
    abstract:
      "Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a dominant sector in technology, with Illinois assured to become a global competitor after Governor JB Pritzker announced a $500 million investment in the quantum industry. Despite recent advances, producing quantum computers and educating future quantum scientists remain challenging. Introducing students to quantum information processing through quantum gates is essential for building a foundational knowledge of quantum computing.",
    introduction:
      "Quantum computing is an advanced field of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. Traditional computers use binary bits, which represent either 0 or 1, while quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously. This unique capability enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations at unprecedented speeds, offering significant potential in fields such as cryptography and complex algorithms. Although still in its early stages, quantum computing holds promise for solving problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computing.",
    methods: "",
    results:
      "Through IBM’s quantum computer simulator and the understanding of how qubits are basically manipulated with quantum gates that involve superposition and entanglement, we were able to install and program in Qiskit and QC.py (visual representation), a quantum circuit where we were able to test and run the BV algorithm.",
    conclusion:
      "As part of our research, we were able to dive through a profound level in Quantum Computing and developed materials for undergrad computer science students, and found how the applications of quantum transformation gates are implemented into Quantum algorithms. While this part of the industry keeps expanding, this initiative will allow us to motivate and impact our communities to the world of Quantum.",

That tradition continues to this day and has expanded to include an array of academic disciplines, allowing the University to embrace fully the community in which it resides. Northeastern is regarded as the most diverse public comprehensive university in the Midwest and is designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Diversity is an important factor in the character of Northeastern and in the social fabric of its student body. The University has an enrollment of more than 7,000 students; African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American students represent roughly 60 percent of the student body.",

In 2018, CAHSI received funding from the NSF, one of only five in the inaugural year to be designated as a National INCLUDES (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discovers in Engineering and Science) alliance. CAHSI’s strategic actions accelerate inclusive change as well as engage administrators, faculty and professional staff, and entities from the public and private sectors.  CAHSI sets forth a flexible process using the conditions of collective impact that furthers the interchange of knowledge creation, adaptation, dissemination, and assessment. CAHSI has a distinguished Board of Advisors (BOA) who evaluate CAHSI’s progress and make recommendations regarding its strategic direction.Because of its evidence-based impact, CAHSI has been nationally recognized in 2015 by the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics as a Bright Spot in Hispanic Education and by Excelencia in Education through its Growing What Works database.",
